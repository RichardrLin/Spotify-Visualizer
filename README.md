Last year, Spotify chose to highlight the top streamed songs from different parts of the world via Wrap Mapped. While the web page serves as a quick visual summary of these statistics, one canâ€™t help but ask: are there any connections to be made between geographical regions and music preference? If so, what can we do with these connections? What insights can we extract from this? This is ultimately the goal of our project where we aim to shed light on the music preference and patterns of various regions/countries and how cultural globalisation has impacted the music industry. This program include but not limited to, a predictive algorithm for song recommendations, a function that returns the most common artist/song between two countries and a function which returns the country that has the most commonly occurring artist/song with a chosen country. Furthermore, in terms of visual output, we have added a few visualisations depicting the top songs by continent, country, city and similarity scores between regions respectively, along with a console which the user can utilise to draw further insights.
